# Windows GUI Tool for iDevice Activation Server Simulator (C#)

This directory contains the C# Windows Forms version of the iDevice Activation Server Simulator.

## Projects

*   **ActivationLogicLib:** A C# class library containing the core logic for:
    *   Generating activation records (`ActivationGenerator.cs`).
    *   Managing the SQLite database (`DatabaseManager.cs`).
    *   Application settings (`AppSettings.cs`).
*   **WindowsFormsApp:** The Windows Forms application that provides the GUI for:
    *   Starting/stopping an embedded HTTP server.
    *   Displaying server logs.
    *   Managing simulated device lock status.

## Planned NuGet Packages

The C# projects will likely require the following NuGet packages (to be added via Visual Studio or `dotnet add package`):

*   For `ActivationLogicLib` and/or `WindowsFormsApp`:
    *   `System.Data.SQLite.Core`: For SQLite database connectivity.
    *   (Potentially) A library for Plist parsing/generation if `System.Xml.Linq` proves insufficient for Apple's specific Plist format.
    *   `BouncyCastle.Cryptography` (or similar): May be needed if .NET's built-in cryptography classes lack direct equivalents for some specific PKCS#7/CMS operations or certificate manipulations used in the Python version, though the goal is to use `System.Security.Cryptography` as much as possible.

## Build and Run

To build and run this C# application, you would typically:
1.  Open the solution file (e.g., `windows_gui_tool.sln`, not created by this agent) in Visual Studio.
2.  Or, use the `dotnet` CLI:
    ```bash
    cd windows_gui_tool/WindowsFormsApp
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```
(Note: `.csproj` and `.sln` files are not generated by this agent but would be part of a standard .NET project setup.)

## Database

This application will be configured to use an SQLite database, typically `activation_simulator.sqlite`. The path will be managed in `AppSettings.cs` and might point to the existing database created by the Python version or a new one.
